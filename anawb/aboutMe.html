					Hello!<br/>
					In January 23rd 2011, I came into this land of opportunity and was fortunate to be accepted as a Computer Science female at the University of Massachusetts-Lowell; studying what I have always wanted since I was little. I wanted to become an engineer just like my father. He has influenced me throughout my life by bringing home the latest technology we could afford in Peru and teaching me about their uses. Technology is his passion, and through him it became mine as well.<br/>
					I graduated in May 2015, and thought life could not get any better... oh boy was I wrong! I became a proud American citizen in June 2015 and got my first job at Syntel. I have never been happier, I used to hear my dad say "I do what I love, and I love what I do"; Now, after so many years I finally understand how good it is to wake up in the morning, grab your computer and start coding. Coding is my passion, I love coding because I love being challenged, no one will ever know everything about computers, technology is always changing; hence, you never stop learning. Another reason why I like what I do is that I am a people-person, you are never alone during those frustrating moments where code is not working and no one knows why, your team mates are always more than happy to help you. Even though, I don't live in Peru, Peru lives in me. Peru is the country that gave me life and USA has helped me shape into the person I have always wanted to be. A programmer.
